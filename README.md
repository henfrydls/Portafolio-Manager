# Portfolio Manager (Django)

A professional portfolio and blog platform for developers and technology consultants. The application is built on Django 5.2, ships with a modern front-end, and includes tooling to manage projects, blog posts, skills, languages, and resumes from a friendly admin dashboard. English and Spanish translations are handled through django-parler with optional LibreTranslate automation.

> Important: All runtime configuration (branding, personal data, content catalogs, etc.) is managed through environment variables and the Django admin. Edit the codebase only when you want to extend features or adjust the layout.

## Repository

- GitHub: https://github.com/henfrydls/Portafolio-Manager.git
- Default branch: `main`

## Highlights

- Responsive portfolio layout with fixed sidebar navigation.
- Admin analytics dashboard summarizing visits, inbox messages, and catalog stats.
- Project catalog with rich metadata, ordering, visibility control, and knowledge base links.
- Medium-style blog with categories, tags, featured images, and publication workflow.
- Resume module that renders a public HTML profile and generates PDF downloads.
- Secure contact form with rate limiting, server-side validation, and inbox management.
- Automatic translation pipeline (EN/ES) powered by django-parler and LibreTranslate.
- Hardened uploads with file-type checks, image optimization, and safe storage.
- SEO helpers including sitemaps, canonical metadata, and structured data snippets.

## Technology Stack

- Django 5.2 LTS
- SQLite for local development (swap for PostgreSQL/MySQL in production)
- Bootstrap-based theme bundled with WhiteNoise for static delivery
- Pillow for image processing
- Optional Docker Compose stack for LibreTranslate integration

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- pip
- Git
- (optional) Docker Desktop 4.0+ if you plan to run the compose stack

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/henfrydls/Portafolio-Manager.git
cd Portafolio-Manager

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
# source .venv/bin/activate   # macOS / Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
```

Copy the example environment file and customise the values:

```bash
copy .env.example .env        # Windows
# cp .env.example .env        # macOS / Linux
```

Minimum variables to review:

- `SECRET_KEY`: generate a unique value (`python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key as g; print(g())"`)
- `DEBUG=True` for local development
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS=localhost,127.0.0.1`
- Email settings if you need outbound notifications

Initialize the database and start the development server:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
python manage.py runserver
```

Visit the following URLs:

- Portfolio: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>
- Admin dashboard: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/>

## Docker Compose (Optional)

Run the entire stack (Django + LibreTranslate) with Docker:

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # or use copy on Windows
docker compose up --build
```

Services:

- Django app: <http://127.0.0.1:8000/>
- LibreTranslate API: <http://127.0.0.1:5000/>

The `web` container mounts the project directory, so code edits trigger a reload. Stop the stack with `docker compose down`.

## Initial Configuration Checklist

1. Sign in to the Django admin and complete your **Profile** record.
2. Review the autogenerated catalog entries (project types, categories, knowledge bases). They are seeded via migrations; if you re-run migrations on a fresh database you will always get exactly one record per slug.
3. Add projects, blog posts, skills, experiences, languages, and resume entries.
4. Configure **Dashboard -> Settings** to enable automatic translations. Point `translation_api_url` to LibreTranslate (local or hosted) and toggle `auto_translate_enabled`.
5. Test the public website and contact form to confirm emails and analytics tracking are working.

## Documentation Index

- `SETUP.md`: detailed installation, troubleshooting, and maintenance guide.
- `docs/CONFIGURATION_GUIDE.md`: environment variables, production hints, and security settings.
- `docs/ADMIN_USAGE.md`: workflows for managing profile, projects, blog posts, and catalogs.
- `docs/EMAIL_SETUP.md`: SMTP configuration for Gmail, Outlook, and custom providers.
- `docs/TEST_DATA.md`: using the management command to populate sample content.
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md`: master table of contents that links every guide.

## Developer Utilities

- Run tests: `python manage.py test`
- Seed demo content (local shell): `python manage.py populate_test_data`
- Seed demo content (Docker): `docker compose exec web python manage.py populate_test_data`
- Reset demo content: delete `db_development.sqlite3` or run `python manage.py populate_test_data --reset`
- Review translation status: `python verify_translations.py`

## Production Considerations

- Set `DEBUG=False`, configure strong `SECRET_KEY`, and lock down `ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- Switch the database to a managed service (PostgreSQL recommended) and update `.env`.
- Serve static files via a CDN or reverse proxy; configure media storage (S3, Azure Blob, etc.).
- Use HTTPS and apply Django security middleware settings (`SECURE_*`, `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE`, etc.).
- Provision a robust email backend (e.g., SendGrid, Mailgun, SES).
- Add monitoring/logging (Sentry, ELK, or similar) as part of your deployment pipeline.
