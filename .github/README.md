## 🎯 Branch Strategy

```
main (protected)
├── develop
├── feature/*
├── bugfix/*
├── refactor/*
└── hotfix/*
```

### Branch Protection Rules

**`main` branch:**
- Requires PR approval
- Requires status checks to pass:
  - CI Pipeline
  - Security Scanning
  - Code Review
- No force pushes
- No deletions

**`develop` branch:**
- Requires status checks to pass
- No force pushes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Running Workflows Locally

#### 1. Install act (GitHub Actions local runner)
```bash
# macOS
brew install act

# Linux
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash

# Windows
choco install act-cli
```

#### 2. Run CI pipeline locally
```bash
act -j test
```

#### 3. Run security scans locally
```bash
act -j security
```

### Running Tests Manually
```bash
# In Docker
docker compose exec web python manage.py test portfolio.tests

# With coverage
docker compose exec web coverage run --source='portfolio' manage.py test portfolio.tests
docker compose exec web coverage report
```
